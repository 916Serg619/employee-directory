# Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I had to create an employee directory using React JS.

## Usage

As the user, I want to be able to identify an employee's information based off a name search, or by sorting the employees by name or date of birth

## Installation

npm i

## Challenges/Difficulties

My initial challenges came with syntax and certain method executions. I followed a tutorial online, but after experiementing with other projects, as well as getting some help from my fellow peers, I am going to re create this app in a form that is more organized, so that I can get a better understanding of props and components. I feel like isolating each component is a standard when it comes to developing a React app, at least from what I am seeing.
